# Chapter-01 : Notes

## 1. PlayGrounds

1. The set of tools you use to write software is called a **toolchain.**
2. The part of the toolchain into which you write your code is known as the Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
3. Xcode includes a handy document type called a playground, which allows you to quickly write and test code without building a complete app

## 1.1 Overview

1. **Source editor**: This is the area in which you’ll write your Swift code. It’s much like a text editor such as Notepad or TextEdit. You’ll notice the use of what’s known as a monospaced font, meaning all characters are the same width. This makes the code much easier to read and format.

2. **Results sidebar**: This area shows the results of your code. You’ll learn more about how code executes as you read through the book. The results sidebar will be the main place you’ll look to confirm your code is working as expected.

3. **Resources tree**: This shows the list of resources contained within the playground. Here you’ll find a tree of resources for the playground, starting with the main playground file, then additional sources and resources. This allows you to build very complex playgrounds that split up the sources into multiple files.

4. **Execution control**: This control lets you run the entire playground file or clear state so you can run it again. By default, playgrounds do not execute automatically. You can change this setting to execute with every change by long pressing on it and selecting “Automatically Run”.

5. **Activity viewer**: This shows the status of the playground. In the screenshot, it shows that the playground has finished executing and is ready to handle more code in the source editor. When the playground is executing, this viewer will indicate this with a spinner.

6. **Left panel control**: This toggles the left panel where the resources tree is. Keep this closed for now.

7. **Right panel control**: This toggles the right panel. Here you’ll find information about the source file that’s open. You’ll usually keep this closed.

8. **Bottom panel control**: This toggles the bottom panel. In here, you’ll find output from the running playground. You’ll open this later.
